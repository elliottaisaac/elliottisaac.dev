            <p class="upper workDesc"> I read about this really interesting fractal online. I decided to build it into a custom generator that draws the fractal dot by dot, up to one million. I also built my own color picking UI out of the HTML range slider so you can change the colors of the fractal while it's drawing. Quite fun!</p>

      <p class="homepageText bio">Too often companies get stuck with a cookie-cutter web presences that fail to emulate the distinctiveness of their businesses. Lame and bland rather than name brand. I can help. What I love the most about working on front-end development is that it affords the ability to build truly unique things and put them out there in the world; moreover, only two tools are needed for the build: creativity and problem solving. With the nearly limitless possibilities of the medium I see no reason why websites can't or shouldn't be hand-crafted to embody every bit of the uniqueness and innovation of the people or organizations they represent.
